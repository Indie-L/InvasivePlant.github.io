   By nature, invasive species endanger native species and ecosystems and threaten the economic well-being of the areas they affect. Invasive plants differ from non-native species in that non-natives donâ€™t necessarily cause significant harm to the ecosystems they inhabit. Large-scale data collection can be difficult, but there is a large distribution of a variety of invasive species across the state of Georgia. Databases such as iNaturalist provide large datasets that show data points representing global diversity. Very few studies show the effects of specific invasives on native plant distribution and abundance. This research aims to identify the effects of English ivy (Hedera helix) on the distribution and abundance of three native plant species: red maple (Acer rubrum), Christmas fern (Polystichum acrostichoides), and Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia). I hypothesize that English ivy will have a significant effect on the distribution of the three selected native species. RStudio was used to analyze data collected from iNaturalist between 2020 and 2025. I predict that there will be a difference in the abundance of the three native species relative to the abundance of English ivy. Using RStudio will provide the ability to graph the abundance of species throughout the selected time period and identify any patterns. The ability to understand the impact of individual natives could provide crucial information about the impacts of invasive species on native plants and ecosystems.
